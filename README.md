# Homebrew tap

This repository is my Homebrew tap containing Homebrew formulae for my software. Currently only x86_64 binaries for macOS is provided. Binaries for Homebrew for Linux (Linuxbrew) are available on request.

## VideoCapture

To install and run my custom VideoCapture application as proposed on [my blog post titled VideoCapture](https://tomkwok.com/posts/videocapture/), run the following commands:

```
brew install tomkwok/tap/videocapture
videocapture
```
